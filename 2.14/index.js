// Status codes are numeric messages exchanged between a server and a client (like a web browser) when using a protocol like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
// These codes indicate whether a request was successful, failed, or needs further action
// INFORMATIONAL: The request was received and the process is continuing. (e.g., 100 Continue) (100 – 199)

// SUCCESS:The request was successfully processed. (e.g., 200 OK) (200-299) // this is the by default satus code that we get if the server sends us some response

// REDIRECTION : Further action is needed to complete the request. The client should follow instructions from the server.  (300 - 399)

//CLIENT ERROR: The request itself is wrong or invalid and cannot be completed by the server. (e.g., 404 Not Found) (400 - 499)

//SERVER ERROR : The server encountered an error and couldn't complete the request. (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) (500-599)

// we can implement this codes in the below call back fucntion
